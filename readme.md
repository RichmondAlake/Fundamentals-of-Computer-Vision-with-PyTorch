# Fundamentals of Computer Vision with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through the fundamentals of computer vision using the PyTorch framework. The notebook is structured to provide a hands-on approach to learning deep learning concepts, implementing neural networks, and applying them to various computer vision tasks. This notebook is to be used in conjuction with the video course.

## Modules Overview

### Module 2: Deep Learning with PyTorch
- Implementation of basic neural networks.
- Operations on tensors, including reshaping, slicing, and mathematical operations.
- Utilization of GPU for tensor operations if available.

### Module 3: Solving Computer Vision Problems
- Advanced techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), object detection, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation.
- Practical applications using pre-trained models like YOLOv5 for object detection and DeepLabV3 for semantic segmentation..

### Module 5: MLOps  
- Integration with Data Version Control [`Data Version Control`](/module_5/module_5_data_version_control.ipynb)
- Monitoring with Weights & Biases [`Weights and Biases`](/module_5/module_5_weights_biases_exp_tracking.ipynb)
